- SolB, derived from the combination of “Solana” and “billing,” serves as an alternative to the current billing system. It replaces traditional billing mechanisms and addresses concerns related to the security and trustworthiness of data storage in existing systems.

- SolB represents a hybrid billing system, offering clients the flexibility to store data locally or on the blockchain, allowing them to utilize both options. SolB ensures that customer data is handled securely, in a trustless, and decentralized manner.

- SolB integrates blockchain technology with existing technologies to establish a decentralized, secure, and transparent environment for both clients and customers.

- In summary, SolB addresses the issues present in current billing systems by offering a hybrid environment that allows clients to effectively manage, store, and update their financial and user data, among other elements.

- As a hybrid billing system, SolB consists of two primary components:

## Invoicer :

- Within SolB, the Invoicer serves as a utility tool provided to our clients for invoicing and storing bills on their preferred platform. The Invoicer offers the flexibility of storing data on a local database, a blockchain system, or both.

## Expenser:
